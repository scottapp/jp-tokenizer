# A simple Japanese text to tokens extraction script

I wrote the scripts to parse the Japanese vocabulary data files that I found online, into other formats, which then can be used as inputs to a simple flashcard program that I wrote to help me with studying. 

For copyright reasons I did not include the Japanese vocabulary pdf and csv data files that I used for testing.

But you could easily find the data files online to test the scripts yourself.
